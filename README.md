# üìò Java DSA Journey üöÄ

Welcome to my complete **Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA)** learning journey using **Java**. This repository is structured topic-wise and contains clean, commented Java code for various problems along with my personal notes and resources.

> üíª I'm learning DSA to become placement-ready for SDE roles at top tech companies.
