# 📦 Arrays 

This folder contains Java-based array problems, categorized by difficulty and patterns. These problems build strong foundations for coding interviews and real-world applications.

## ## ✅ Day 1: Basic Array Operations – [`BasicProblems.java`](./BasicProblems.java)

### ✅ Covered Concepts:

- Array declaration & input
- Printing array using `Arrays.toString()`
- Finding maximum & minimum element
- Reversing array (in-place using two pointers)
- Linear search (O(n))
- Binary search (on sorted array – O(log n))

---

## 📌 How to Run

1. Compile the file:
   ```bash
   javac BasicProblems.java
2. Run the program
   ```bash
   java BasicProblems
3. Sample Input
   ```php
   Enter array size: 5
   Enter array elements: 4 2 9 7 1

| # | Problem                               | Concept             |
|---|----------------------------------------|---------------------|
| 1 | Move all zeroes to end                | Two-pointer         |
| 2 | Rotate array by `k` positions         | Reversal algorithm  |
| 3 | Check if array is sorted              | Simple logic        |
| 4 | Find second largest element           | Linear scan         |
| 5 | Remove duplicates (sorted array only) | Two-pointer         |
